# iContact
This is my effort to recreate and improve upon the default Contacts iOS app by allowing users to see the groups they create and view their favorited contacts (completely programmatically).

## Why create this project?
* In the default contacts app, you can greate a group using the "Company" text field. However, you are unable to view your groups and who is in them, other than searching the group name. This presents a potential problem for users if they forget what they named a group they created, which creates a friction point in the user experience. 
  * My goal is to add a "Circles" tab. Circles will be the new version of the Company field that exists, but opens it up for further customization and opens up the app to be used for social circle integration. 
  * In this tab, users can see their created circles, add a description, and see the members in the circle.
* Additionally, the default contacts app does not allow users to add contacts to a "favorites" list, but instead has that feature in the phone app. 
  * In order to create a unified consumer experience, I decided to incorporate this feature to my contacts app.
  * Users should be able to add favorites with a swipe gesture, and then view/add them in the contacts tab.
