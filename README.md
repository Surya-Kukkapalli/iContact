# iContact
This is my effort to recreate and improve upon the default Contacts iOS app by allowing users to see the groups they create and view their favorited contacts.

## Why create this project?
* In the default contacts app, you can greate a group using the "Company" text field. However, you are unable to view the groups and who is in them, other than searching the group name. 
  * My goal is to add a Groups tab where users can see their created groups, add a group description, and see the members in the group.
* Additionally, the default contacts app does not allow users to add contacts to a "favorites" list, but instead has that feature in the phone app. 
  * In order to create a unified customer experience, I decided to incorporate this feature to my contacts app.
